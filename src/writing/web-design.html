				<p>Below I mentioned seeing videos of Persona UI, and I have since played a Persona game.
					I really, really enjoy the UI in <em>Persona 5</em>, but I think something that goes underappreciated
					relative to flashy animations is snappiness. The <em>Persona 5</em> UI is, for the most part, very responsive,
					even while having lots of movement and animation, and they accomplish this by having the interactive elements
					be interactive long before the animation finishes. Additionally, I think that the animations cancel nicely,
					and flow together even when they're not played out to completion, which makes rapid movement through the UI
					feel incredible. At the end of the day, people are interacting with your UI to do something, and responsiveness
					should not be sacrificed for visuals.
				</p>
				<p>
					In my humble, uninformed opinion, you should build your UIs for the high-end of usage frequency cases. Imagine a daily
					user of your software. Their movements through your software are probably automatic to them, and the UI should feel just as automatic.
					If say, there's a drawer that comes out when you click on something to edit some properties, don't think about the first time or first twenty times
					that this flow will happen, think about the thousandth. If there's a 0.5s animation for the drawer open, that's going to get tiring real fast.
					Maybe it showing up instantly without any animation doesn't feel as flashy when you're developing, but you're not developing for the clicked-five-times
					use case.
				</p>
				<p>
					I think the main reason I enjoy the Persona UIs is that they feel so active. They almost always involve figures of people
					moving and striking different poses which I think gives it a greater feeling of motion. It would genuinely be a dream to create
					a beautiful, responsive UI like the Persona ones.

				<p>I don't know how to design good websites (maybe that was already obvious to you based on your tastes in web 
				design). I am a huge fan of the plain HTML + minimal CSS look: Nat Friedman websites <em>are</em> goated. But 
				that can't be the pinnacle of good web design.</p>
				<p>Even though I'm not really sure what is good, I do know some things that I dislike. I really
				dislike when websites hijack the scroll and do something funky with it. The most annoying one is websites that
				add the "content floats up/appears when you scroll down" when it's completely unnecessary. Another big one is
				horizontal scroll. Another common pattern is when the scrolling is "discrete": either the scroll jumps between
				sections, or the scroll simply makes more content appear on the current section.</p>
				<p>All of these things, in my opinion, are deployed in places where they're unnecessary and don't look good and
				don't make it easy to traverse the website.</p>
				<p>Relatedly, it should be easy for me to find what I'm looking for on your website! I really dislike company websites that don't make it clear what they're doing. This is not a point of "visual" design but I think this is a component
				of design nonetheless.</p>
				<p>I do like very flashy interactive design sometimes. This is not a website, but I've seen clips on Twitter of
				the menus in one of the Persona games and I thought it was really beautiful. I'm not really sure how to
				translate that to websites.</p>
				<p>I also obviously have some aesthetic biases: I love "old technology" looking things, whether that's simple
				HTML pages or something like the P*DA from Pokemon Colosseum (admittedly that one doesn't look exceptionally
				beautiful, but there is a charm to it. Anyways I'm only mentioning it because I saw someone's personal website
				today that kind of reminded me of it).</p>
