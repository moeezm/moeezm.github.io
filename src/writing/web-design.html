			<p>I don't know how to design good websites (maybe that was already obvious to you based on your tastes in web 
			design). I am a huge fan of the plain HTML + minimal CSS look: Nat Friedman websites <em>are</em> goated. But 
			that can't be the pinnacle of good web design.</p>
			<p>Even though I'm not really sure what is good, I do know some things that I dislike. I really
			dislike when websites hijack the scroll and do something funky with it. The most annoying one is websites that
			add the "content floats up/appears when you scroll down" when it's completely unnecessary. Another big one is
			horizontal scroll. Another common pattern is when the scrolling is "discrete": either the scroll jumps between
			sections, or the scroll simply makes more content appear on the current section.</p>
			<p>All of these things, in my opinion, are deployed in places where they're unnecessary and don't look good and
			don't make it easy to traverse the website.</p>
			<p>Relatedly, it should be easy for me to find what I'm looking for on your website! I really dislike company websites that don't make it clear what they're doing. This is not a point of "visual" design but I think this is a component
			of design nonetheless.</p>
			<p>I do like very flashy interactive design sometimes. This is not a website, but I've seen clips on Twitter of
			the menus in one of the Persona games and I thought it was really beautiful. I'm not really sure how to
			translate that to websites.</p>
			<p>I also obviously have some aesthetic biases: I love "old technology" looking things, whether that's simple
			HTML pages or something like the P*DA from Pokemon Colosseum (admittedly that one doesn't look exceptionally
			beautiful, but there is a charm to it. Anyways I'm only mentioning it because I saw someone's personal website
			today that kind of reminded me of it).</p>
