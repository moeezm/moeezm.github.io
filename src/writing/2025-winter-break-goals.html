                <p>It's now the winter holidays and I have about 2 weeks off. I have a few things I want to do:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Get a score of &lt;=75 on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santa-2025">
                        Kaggle tree packing contest</a> (without copying some public notebook)</li>
                    <li>Prove termination of <a href="https://x.com/notmoeezm/status/1999989622924104075">this function</a> in a reasonable way 
                        (or learn enough to be convinced that more convoluted methods are the only way you can do it)</li>
                    <li>Translate a program I wrote at work from Python to Rust</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If I can do these three things I'll be very happy.</p>
