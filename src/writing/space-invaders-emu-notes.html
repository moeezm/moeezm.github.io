			<h1>Notes on making a Space Invaders emulator</h1>

		<main>
			<p><a href="www.emulator101.com">emulator101.com</a> is a good starting resource. I didn't really want 
			to keep reading once I got to the "Cocoa Platform" section b/c I thought it was going to just be GUI library 
			specific stuff. Once I got into actually coding, the User's Manual and the Programming Manual for the Intel 
			8080 as well as the Wikipedia article were very good references and covered the details I needed to know. For 
			a quick reference on the hardware stuff he talks about, just use the Computer Archaeology website he links.</p>
			<p><strong>The Auxiliary Carry flag and the DAA instruction</strong>: I'm pretty sure emulator101.com 
			talks about ignoring this, but the game actually uses this for displaying the score. To be completely honest, 
			I don't fully understand how the AC flag works for subtraction operations, so I left it because the game only 
			needs it for additions. Thankfully it's straightforward for addition operations.
			The DAA instruction affects the AC and the regular carry flag in a bit of a strange way, 
			and you can read that in the Programming Manual. It also turns out, if you read the manual, that the AND 
			operation with registers/memory (so not immediate value) affects the AC flag. I got from <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/14977/auxiliary-carry-and-the-intel-8080s-logical-instructions">this stackexchange 
				answer</a> that it sets it to the OR of the 3rd bits (counting from least significant, starting from 0).</p>
			<p>It's also a good idea to be careful about the rotate (left shift or right shift) instructions, I messed them
			up the first time.</p>
			<p>If you're having issues with your CPU emulator, it might be a good idea to test it (I had to do this). You
			can find other people's 8080 emulators on github, clone them, and try to run some of the test programs they
			use. You can step through both your and their emulator until there's a difference in the state.</p>
			<p><strong>Interrupts</strong>: Not 100% sure about this one (it might be in the manuals somewhere) but I think
			it's a good idea to disable interrupts once an interrupt is received. The game has code anyways in its routine
			it runs at interrupt to reenable them at some point. The point of disabling interrupts is I believe I was
			running into a stack overflow where the game would start stacking up interrupts as it got interrupted before
			finishing its current interrupt routine.</p>
			<p><strong>Timing</strong>: I went into this project kind of clueless, and if you're like me, you might expect
			that it's not that hard to get your CPU emulator to run at exactly the clock speed you choose. However, timing
			is more finicky on computers than I imagined, and this is probably not possible. The other thing is that <strong>don't use threads</strong>. These are more cursed than I imagined. The important thing to realize is you only need to
			run the instructions that needed to run before each frame gets displayed, so those are the significant
			"deadlines" the CPU needs to show up for, and it doesn't have to be accurately timed in between.</p>
			<p>The hack I ended up going with is I would run like a 1000 instructions after the half interrupt, and then
			run the number of cycles the CPU would do in 1/60th of a second after the full interrupt. Works ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
			<p>Also, your first idea for timing a loop on a specific schedule would be to use some sort of sleep function,
			but I became very convinced that usleep is incredibly unreliable. You can read a little bit underneath this
			<a href="https://x.com/AlterranIRL/status/1811688847094288762">tweet</a> about timing and different tools like
			nanosleep. Just try different things and see what works.</p>
