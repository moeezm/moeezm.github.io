			<h2>Derivation</h2>
			<p>
			Mobius inversion is the following result: consider two sequences \(a_n\) and \(b_n\) defined for
			\(n \geq 1\). Suppose that \(b_n = \sum_{d \mid n} a_d\). We wish to "invert" this formula and find
			a formula that expresses \(a_n\) in terms of the \(b_n\).
			</p>

			<p>
			We will reframe this problem in terms of Dirichlet series. Consider some arbitrary sequence \(x_n\) defined
			for \(n \geq 1\). Then we can associate to \(x_n\) its Dirichlet series, 
			\(X(s) = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{x_n}{n^s}\).
			It is easy to see that multiplying two Dirichlet series \(X(s)\) and \(Y(s)\) (with associated sequences
			\(x_n\) and \(y_n\)) gives the Dirichlet series for a sequence \(z_n\) given by
			\(z_n = \sum_{ij = n} x_iy_j\).
			</p>

			<p>
			Consider the sequence of all 1s. Let its associated Dirichlet series be 
			\(E(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s}\).
			Then we can see that \(b_n = \sum_{d \mid n} a_d\) is equivalent to saying that \(B(s) = A(s)E(s)\).
			Thus, if we can find a Dirichlet series \(M(s)\) such that \(M(s)E(s) = 1\), then multiplying by \(M(s)\)
			on both sides would give us \(A(s) = B(s)M(s)\), allowing us to express \(a_n\) in terms of the \(b\)'s.
			</p>

			<p>
			Let \(m_n\) be the associated sequence to \(M(s)\). The expression \(M(s)E(s) = 1\) is equivalent to saying
			that \(m_1 = 1\) and for all \(n \geq 2\), \(\sum_{d \mid n} m_d = 0\). Thus, it's easy to see that
			\(m_p = -1\) for \(p\) prime. Now consider \(n = p^k\), a power of a prime. Because we need
			\(m_1 + m_p + m_{p^2} = 0\), we have that \(m_{p^2} = 0\) and the same is true for all higher powers
			by induction.
			</p>

			<p>
			We will show that \(m_n\) is a multiplicative sequence, that is, for \(a, b\) coprime, \(m_{ab} = m_a m_b\).
			We will do this by induction on \(n = ab\). The base case \(n = 1\) is trivially true.
			For the inductive step, if \(a\) or \(b\) are \(1\) then it is trivially true. So consider \(a, b \geq 2\).
			Therefore, \(a, b \lt n\). Now, because each of the following three sums are zero, we have:
			
			\[
			\left( \sum_{d \mid a} m_d \right) \left( \sum_{d \mid b} m_d \right) = \sum_{d \mid n} m_d
			\]

			Expanding the LHS and inspecting you can see that because \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime, and thus every divisor
			of \(n\) is a product of a divisor of \(a\) and a divisor of \(b\), almost everything cancels (applying the
			induction hypothesis) and you're left with \(m_am_b = m_{n}\) as desired.
			</p>

			<p>
			We now know that \(m_n\) is a multiplicative sequence, and we know its values on prime powers. Thus,
			applying the multiplicative rule, it's easy to see that \(m_1 = 1\), \(m_n = (-1)^k\) if \(n\) is 
			the product of \(k\) different primes, and \(m_n = 0\) if \(n\) has any prime power at least 2 
			(in other words, is divisible by a square).
			</p>

			<p>
			This sequence \(m_n\) is normally called the Mobius function, denoted by \(\mu(n)\).

			<h2>Computing</h2>

			<p>
			Let's turn to practical computational considerations. Suppose we wish to compute \(a_n\) for all \(n\) up to
			some limit \(N\). We can do this in \(O(N\log N)\), in fact without use of the Mobius function.
			First, notice that \(a_n = b_n - \sum_{d \mid n, d \neq n} a_d\). So very naively, you could do this in
			\(O(N\sqrt{N})\). But notice that the sum on the right is the perfect type of thing to compute quickly with
			a sieve. To do this, initialize all \(a_i\) with \(b_i\). Then, loop over, and once you get to \(a_i\),
			subtract it from \(a_{2i}\), \(a_{3i}\), etc.
			</p>

			<p>
			We can also compute the Mobius function easily: do a standard prime sieve. On iteration \(p\) for \(p\)
			prime multiply \(a_{kp}\) by \(-1\) for \(k\) not divisible by \(p\) and multiply by \(0\) otherwise.
