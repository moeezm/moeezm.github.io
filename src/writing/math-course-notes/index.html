				<li><a href="lebesgue/">Lebesgue Measure and Integration</a></li>
				Notes covering the Lebesgue theory of measure and integration in \(\mathbb{R}^n\). Mostly covering content from the Stein and Shakarchi book and my Analysis 3 class. No abstract measure theory here, everything in the concrete setting of reals.
