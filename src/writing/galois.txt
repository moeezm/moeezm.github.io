GALOIS THEORY REVIEW
field extension - bigger field
adjoining an element F(x) - smallest field extension containing F and containing x, equivalently all rational functions in x
splitting field of polynomial f(x) - smallest field extension that (equivalently) f(x) splits into linear factors under or contains all the roots of f(x)

degrees multiply: if F c B c E then E/F = E/B * B/F
degree of adjoining an element F(x) doesn't have to be infinite, if x is satisfied by some polynomial over F

algebraic element over F - element that is root of some polynomial over F
minimal polynomial - an algebraic element has a smallest degree polynomial. simple division algorithm argument shows this must divide every other polynomial that satisfies the element. thus unique up to constant factor
minimal poly is clearly irreducible, and an irreducible polynomial is the minimal polynomial for all of its roots

degree of field extension by adjoining an algebraic element is the degree of the minimal polynomial. if a is an algebraic element satisfied by minimal polynomial f(x) then F(a) isomorphic to F[x]/f(x)
we can cook up algebraic elements out of nowhere by simply considering F[x]/f(x) if f is irreducible. x then is our algebraic element
a splitting field is made from a finite number of algebraic elements adjoined so the degree must be finite (each time, you multiply the deg of the minimal polynomial)

a group character is an homomorphism from a group to the multiplicative group of some field
homomorphisms between fields induce group characters

for a field, the set of automorphisms forms a group
consider F c E. the set of automorphisms that fixes F is clearly a group as well
the fixed field of a set of automorphisms is just the largest field they all fix

if you have a set of n automorphisms that with F as fixed field, then E/F is >= n
if F is characteristic 0 and n is the size of the group that has F as fixed field, then E/F = n

galois extension - Aut(E/F) has F as fixed field
normal extension - every irreducible polynomial in F that has a root in E splits into linear factors over E
separable polynomial - # of distinct roots = degree, i.e. all roots are distinct (in the splitting field ofc)
separable extension - the minimal polynomial for every element is separable
galois is equivalent to: normal and separable, splitting field of some separable polynomial, size of aut(E/F) = degree
the galois group of a separable polynomial is the galois group of the splitting field of that polynomial
simple extension - generated by a single element
finite separable extensions are simple
