				<p>Suppose you're given a coin that has a probability \(p\) of turning
				up heads and a probability \(1-p\) of turning up tails. What's the
				expected number of flips before you see a heads? The intuitive answer
				is \(1/p\). For example, in a fair coin, it would take \(2\) flips on
				average before you see a heads. Or in a fair die, it would take \(6\)
				rolls on average before you see a \(6\).</p>

				<p>The geometric probability distribution models the above scenario, and
				it's not too hard to see that the probability of it taking \(k\) flips
				is \((1-p)^{k-1}p\). Then, the expected value is a well-known infinite
				series that comes out to \(1/p\).</p>

				<p>I would like to present a way of deriving this result by considering
				a betting game. The general set up of the game is that you put up \$\(1\)
				on a single flip. If the flip comes up heads, you win \$\(k\). 
				Otherwise, you don't win anything.</p>

				<p>What should \(k\) be for the expected profit of the game to be \(0\)?
				This is simple: with probability \(p\) we make a profit of \$\(k - 1\)
				, and with probability \(1-p\) we make a profit of \$\(-1\). So, the expected
				profit is: \(p(k-1) + (1-p)(-1)\) which gives \(k = 1/p\). </p>

				<p>Now, fixing our payout at \(1/p\), let's consider the simple extension
				of the game to multiple flips. Each flip we bet \$\(1\) that it will be
				heads, and we stop playing as soon as we win.
				Since the expected profit on each flip is \(0\), the expected
				profit over all the flips is still \(0\). Thus, we can write that
				\(\mathbb{E}[payout] = \mathbb{E}[stake]\). But the payout is just \(1/p\),
				since we win exactly one time, and the expected amount staked is just the
				number of flips we bet on.
				</p>

				<p>But in other words, the number of flips we bet on is the number of flips
				it took to see a heads, so the expected number of flips before we see a
				heads is \(1/p\).
				</p>

				<p>I recommend watching the video linked above, since it shows how you can
				extend arguments like this to find the expected number of flips before you
				see a heads and then a tails (\(HT\)), a \(HH\), or any arbitrary finite
				sequence of heads and tails.</p>

			<p>(maybe I'll move these appendices somewhere else but they kind of fit here. also

			noteworthy, at least to me, in the sense that it's not just regurgitating and is
			actually the product of thought. these appendices are regurgitations.)</p>

				<h2>Appendix A: The series calculation</h2>
				<p>Let's do the "well-known infinite series" I mentioned before. So again,
				if \(X\) is geometrically distributed, then \(\mathbb{P}[X=k] = (1-p)^{k-1}p\).
				Thus, the expected value is:
				\[
				\sum_{k=1}^\infty k (1-p)^{k-1}p
				\]
				If we didn't have the factor of \(k\), this would be a very simple geometric
				series. But we can do a bit of work to transform it into one. First, let's factor
				out the \(p\) and forget about it for now. Then, let's consider the general problem
				by replacing \(1-p\) with \(x\). Thus, we want to compute:
				\[
				\sum_{k=1}^\infty k x^{k-1}
				\]
				Then we can integrate this series term by term to get \(\sum_{k=1}^\infty x^k\),
				which is just a geometric series evaluating to \(\frac{x}{1-x}\).
				Thus, we can just differentiate that expression with the quotient rule to get
				\(\frac{(1-x) - (-x)}{(1-x)^2} = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2}\).
				</p>

				<p>This expression is equal to the infinite series we wanted, so we plug in
				\(1-p\) to get \(\frac{1}{p^2}\). But then we can't forget about the \(p\)
				we factored out at the beginning, so the final answer is \(1/p\).

				<h2>Appendix B: Betting argument for expected number of flips before \(HT\)</h2>
				<h6>(taken from the video linked above)</h6>
				<p>
				Let's simplify the game by considering a fair coin. So the payout is \$\(2\).
				Let's also consider multiple people betting. So, person \(i\) joins the table
				and starts betting from flip \(i\), trying their hand at winning by betting on
				seeing a heads and then a tails (\(HT\)). On the first flip a person plays for,
				he bets that the coin will turn up heads. If it doesn't, he loses his money
				and leaves the table. If it does, he wins \$\(2\) and parlays that into betting
				that the next flip is a tails. If it hits tails he wins the total payout of \$\(4\)
				and the game ends for everyone. Otherwise, he loses everything and leaves.
				</p>

				<p>Let's look at the total profit over everyone. Since the payout on each flip
				is \$\(2\), the total expected profit must be 0. And once again, the total amount
				staked is just the number of flips, since each flip brings a new person with
				a new \$\(1\) to bet with. The total payout is just \$\(4\), since the person
				who joined at the second to last flip wins the total \$\(4\), and everyone else
				lost.
				</p>

				<p>Thus, the expected number of flips before a \(HT\) is equal to the expected
				payout, which is \(4\).</p>

				<p>What if we were trying to bet on \(HH\) instead? Then the second to last
				person wins \(4\) again, but the last person also wins \(2\) since he correctly
				predicted a heads. Thus the expected number of flips before \(HH\) is \(6\).
				</p>

				<p>In general, you have to look at the suffixes of your sequence that are also
				a prefix of the sequence to calculate the winnings and so the expected number
				of flips.</p>

				<h2>Appendix C: Two alternative proofs to Appendix B (\(HT\))</h2>
				<p>Let's forget about betting.</p>

				<p>The first solution: Let the expected value be \(x\). If we flip a tails
				first, then the expected number of flips will be \(1 + x\), since we
				wasted the first flip on a tails and then we "reset" the game and started
				playing again (since the next flips don't depend on the previous flips).
				If we flip a heads first, then we just wait the expected number of flips
				until we see a tails, since the sequence will look like \(H...HT\).
				Thus, we have that \(x = \frac{1}{2}(1 + x) + \frac{1}{2}(1 + 2)\) which
				gives \(x = 4\).</p>

				<p>The second solution is a bit simpler: Wait until an \(H\), then wait until a \(T\).
				Thus the sequence will look like \(T..TH...HT\) in general, so the expected
				number of flips is just \(2 + 2 = 4\).</p>

				<p>The first solution works better for the case of \(HH\).</p>

				<h2>Appendix D: The cereal box toy collecting problem</h2>
				<p>Also called the coupon collector problem or other such names. This is a
				simple application of the expected value of the geometric distribution</p>

				<p>The problem is as follows: There are \(n\) different types of toys that
				might come with a cereal box. Each box has exactly one toy, chosen from the
				\(n\) with equal probability. What is the expected number of boxes you need
				to buy before having at least one of each type of toy?</p>

				<p>Let's view it like this: At some point in your collecting journey you've
				already collected \(i\) types of toys. From then on, we can model it with a
				geometric distribution: there is a \(\frac{n-i}{n}\) chance you get a new toy,
				and a \(\frac{i}{n}\) chance you get a toy you already have.
				Thus, the expected number of boxes you need to buy before you get a new toy
				is just \(\frac{n}{n-i}\).</p>

				<p>Then, at the beginning of your collecting journey, you have \(0\) toys.
				Thus you buy \(\frac{n}{n} = 1\) boxes to get a new one. Now you have \(1\)
				toy. So you buy \(\frac{n}{n-1}\) boxes to get a new one. And then \(\frac{n}{n-2}\)
				boxes, and so on. Until you have \(n-1\) toys, and then you buy \(\frac{n}{1} = n\)
				boxes to complete your collection.</p>

				<p>So the expected number of boxes you need to buy is:
				\[
				\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} \frac{n}{n-i}
				\]
				We can just index in reverse to get:
				\[
				\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \frac{n}{i}
				\]
				So it's just \(nH_n\) where \(H_n = 1/1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/n\) is the \(n^{th}\)
				harmonic number. Thus asymptotically it's \(n\log n\).
