			<p>Azumanga daioh is a very very very silly show with distinctive characters and funny gags. At the core of the
			show are a lot of running gags, and each individual character would be too much if the show was solely about 
			them, however the show brings them together and alternates characters in a way that doesn't get tiring.</p>
			<p>Obviously whether or not the gags get tiring is up to personal taste and I can see people finding it annoying
			. A lot of the jokes are definitely very childish. I personally found Tomo to be annoying sometimes, especially
			later on in the show.</p>
			<p>The show is great from the beginning but I think it really hits its stride starting around episode 10 or 11
			(this is around when they start their second year of high school). Most of the episodes I can remember as my 
			favourite are during their second year.</p>
			<p>Early in the second year is an episode about a day in the life of Chiyo. This is really one of the first 
			emotional episodes, and one of my favourites.</p>
			<p>The final stretch of episodes that comprise their third year of high school are also quite good. A lot of 
			them are tinged with more emotion and tension surrounding the bittersweetness of graduating and the stress of 
			university entrance exams and their future. One of my favourite episodes is the one right at the end of their 
			second year where all the characters (even Nyamo with talks of her marriage) question and think about their
			futures.. It's still silly (all the yawning) but is probably the most serious episode of the show. No serious 
			or emotional topics are treated in that much depth (I wouldn't expect them to be) but they are given attention 
			suitable for the type of show AzuDaioh is. It has displays of the sweetness and camaraderie and other things
			like that that you would expect from a slice of life show.</p>
			<p>I've dedicated a lot of words to the "emotional" or "serious" parts of the show, even though they get a 
			relatively small amount of screentime (as well as attention from the fanbase). I did this because I think it's
			important to appreciate AzuDaioh beyond the clips on TikTok or Instagram. Most episodes have some sort of 
			overarching story and/or emotional point(s) that in my opinion make the show truly a good show. The characters 
			and their relationships do slightly grow over the course of the show, and it's nice to see.</p>
			<p>The only real issue I had with the show is that it always did Yomi kinda dirty, and didn't really give her 
			the attention she deserved. I think she was an interesting character, since she was kind of the 
			straight-path/good-head-on-her-shoulders type character. However, even though attention and focused episodes 
			were given to other side characters like Sakaki or Kagura, Yomi didn't really get that.</p>
			<p>I say "side characters" even though there's an ensemble cast because in my opinion, Chiyo is the main 
			character, with Osaka close behind. Tomo is not really a main character, but speaks as much as if she was one. 
			Sakaki is a side character but gets a couple of her own special episodes/moments. Kagura doesn't really get 
			much attention at all and Yomi gets even less. I think they could've really fleshed out Yomi the same way 
			they fleshed out Sakaki.</p>
			<p>Power rankings:
			<ol>
				<li>Osaka</li>
				<li>Sakaki</li>
				<li>Chiyo</li>
				<li>Yukari</li>
				<li>Yomi</li>
			</ol>Honourable mention: Nyamo, for the episode that talks about her getting married.</p>
			<p>In a few words: Azumanga Daioh is a funny and silly show, but it is also a sweet show.</p>
