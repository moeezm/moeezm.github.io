			<p>Assorted anime:</p>
			<p>You can see my anilist <a href="https://anilist.co/user/SnazzySwampert/animelist">here</a>. Don't pay too much attention to the scoring lmao.</p>
			<p>fullmetal alchemist: brotherhood - top of MAL charts for the longest time. no flaws.</p>
			<p>ping pong the animation - sports anime, classic masaaki yuasa art. highly recommend.</p>
			<p>oddtaxi - bit of an oddity about a world of anthromorphic animals. very character-focused. very good.</p>
			<p>frieren - nice slice of life, amazing amazing animation and beautiful fights when action does happen. a bit... repetitive at times, though?</p>
			<p>scissor seven - funny chinese animated show with gorgeous animation and silly antics. short episodes, sometimes directionless.</p>
			<p>dr. stone - kino as hell, science focused. a tiny bit cringe, a tiny bit ridiculous and stereotypes its own characters. watch at least s1 (or even just up until they finish antibiotics)</p>
			<p>keep your hands off eizouken - masaaki yuasa show about three high school girls making anime. inspiring, beautiful visually. oorutaichi soundtrack is awesome. funny and quirky</p>
			<p>my teen romantic comedy snafu/oregairu - classic (i think) of the "loner high school boy" genre</p>
			<p>welcome to the nhk - missionary girl tries to rehabilitate ultra neet hikikomori. awesome. he's just like me. so real.</p>
			<p>jojo (og) - the second part, battle tendency, is awesome. the first part is OK but it's only like 8 eps.</p>
			<p>jojo stardust crusaders - has some good moments and jotaro is cool af but kinda just focused on fighting all the time. dio fight is classic ofc</p>
			<p>tsuki ga kirei - slow calm innocent middle school romance. actually pretty good</p>
			<p>cells at work - learn a little bit about bio while moe versions of cells solve problems lmao. fun</p>
			<p>dragon ball super - goku black is an awesome arc. TOP is kino af and the opening is hype and it's like 35 eps of epic fighting, but the story is a bit lacking</p>
			<p>sonny boy - weird surreal show. gorgeous visuals, amazing AMAZING soundtrack. but the story doesn't make any sense.</p>
			<p>tsuredure children - paraphrased from one of the anilist reviews: highlight reel of all the emotional/cute moments you would see in classic romance shows. centers on various relationships, splitting screen time.</p>
			<p>haven't you heard? i'm sakamoto - funny little show about an impossibly slick and suave high school student. kinda funny sometimes but don't binge watch or else it gets repetitive.</p> 
			<p>Anime movies:</p>
			<p>5cm/s - short 1hr film about a young middle school couple drifting apart after they move because of their parents' work. if you can relate, shinkai's best</p>
			<p>a silent voice - it's been so long since i watched this, but it's good. stuff about depression and bullying</p>
			<p>your name - shinkai's most popular. flawless. so good at making you invested you don't notice the plot holes. of course gorgeous gorgeous visuals. and radwimps best soundtrack work</p>
			<p>weathering with you - shinkai's "your name" follow-up. very good, but not as good. ending kinda sucked imo</p>
			<p>suzume no tojimari - as of 2024, shinkai's most recent. admittedly, i did watch it on my phone in a discord call at 2am, but it kinda sucked. skip it</p>
			<p>garden of words - short 40 min shinkai film. a bit strange but good emotion</p>
			<p>children who chase lost voices - kinda weird fantasy shinkai movie. enjoyable</p> 
			<p>dareka no manazashi - short ~8min shinkai film about growing up and becoming distant from parents. cute and heartwarming. can watch it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSwbnUQJGnA">youtube</a>.</p>
			<p>whisper of the heart - cozy little ghibli movie, music focused, little young romance</p>
			<p>ride your wave - classic masaaki yuasa/science saru art style, gorgeous. good romance story.</p>
			<p>children of the sea - strange ass film i watched once at TIFF. Utterly gorgeous visuals and some super surreal animation sequences. but i couldn't follow the story</p>
			<p>mirai - cozy heartwarming story about little boy who time travels and learns from his grandfather, as well as his little sister from the future. awesome</p>
			<p>into the forest of fireflies' light - kinda interesting forbidden romance-ish story. enjoyable</p>
			<p>angel's egg - i didn't understand this shit. one day i'll watch it not at 3am</p>
