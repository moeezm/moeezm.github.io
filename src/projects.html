			These are some things that I've built/contributed to:
			<ul>
				<li><b><a href="https://devpost.com/software/mirror-6y5tng">Mirror</a> (McGill CodeJam 2023 Winner) </b><i>(w/ Santosh Passoubady, Louis Wei, and Roko Baljak)</i></li>
				A webapp that uses Stable Diffusion and your webcam to show you how you would look in different clothing.
				<li><b><a href="https://github.com/moeezm/rizzAI">rizzAI</a></b> <i>(DEAD)</i></li>
				A Chrome extension that used GPT3 to give you opening messages based on Tinder bios. Integrated with the Tinder webapp. Dead now because OpenAI removed davinci-003 from their API. Maybe one day I'll get it to use a multimodal model.
