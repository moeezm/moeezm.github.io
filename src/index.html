			<p>U3 (aka final year) mathematics student at McGill University</p>

				<h4>Currently (last updated 2024-11-09):</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Starting soon as a software engineer at <a href="https://lisplogics.com/en">Lisplogics</a>,
						focusing on algorithms/optimization.</li>
					<li>Doing a bachelor's thesis this semester, the topic is Erdos's conjecture that any triangle-free 
						graph can be made bipartite by removing at most \(n^2/25\) edges</li> 
					<!--<li>Watching: Dandadan (weekly), <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/175977/My-Deer-Friend-Nokotan/">SK(NK)*3KSTT</a> (paused), The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation out of Debt (paused)</li> -->
					<!-- <li>Coding random things. Right now: an assembler for the Intel 8080, written in 8080 assembly.</li> -->
					<li>Learning Japanese. Used to be big on Anki (with 
						<a href="https://anacreondjt.gitlab.io/docs/coredeck/">this anki deck</a>), but now I just spend 
						my time on my university Japanese course (which uses Nakama 2 as its textbook). Check out the 
						library (navbar) to see some of the Japanese learning resources
						I've amassed. I started learning Japanese because of Tokimeki Memorial.</li>
					<li>I want to start working on an English patch for the Sega Saturn version of Tokimeki Memorial 
						(i.e. the "Forever With You" version). If you have any info on existing patches, let me know on 
						twitter dms or email. Currently only aware of 
						<a href="https://twitter.com/burntends2/status/1500661289307324417">this</a>, of which I last 
						tested the version released in Sept 2023 which crashed after doing the first few activities. It 
						has apparently been recently updated! It does seem like a lot of work, and maybe making this 
						<a href="https://github.com/vgarciasc/xeupiu">texthooker project</a> work is a better use of 
						my time.</li>
					<li>My nootropics stack right now is: Pocari Sweat, nose strips, being happy</li>

				<h4>Things I am interested in hearing about:</h4>
				<p>Ways to make the future feel more visceral/real, opportunities to go slay the Demon King, 
				well-made dating sims (maybe with a stat mechanic?), ambient/field recordings/experimental/instrumental
				hip-hop music, local Montreal scenes of those, good unique anime (if you ctrl-F "anime" on Library you can 
				see what I like), good unique movies/books, non-slop contemporary Japanese literature, better/out-there
				language learning methods/applications (with a focus on Japanese)</p>
