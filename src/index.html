				<h4>Currently (last updated 2025-12-13):</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Playing <em>Catherine</em></li>
					<li>Interested lately in category theory, Lean, etc. I don't know much but I like hearing about
						different type systems. Right now I'm experimenting with writing programs and proving things about them in Lean.
					</li>
					<li>Learning Japanese. I self-studied a bit last year, took a year of classes that used Nakama 2, and am
					back to self-studying. I started because I wanted to play Tokimeki Memorial.</li>
					<!-- <li>I want to start working on an English patch for the Sega Saturn version of Tokimeki Memorial 
						(i.e. the "Forever With You" version). If you have any info on existing patches, let me know on 
						twitter dms or email. Currently only aware of 
						<a href="https://twitter.com/burntends2/status/1500661289307324417">this</a>, of which I last 
						tested the version released in Sept 2023 which crashed after doing the first few activities. It 
						has apparently been recently updated! It does seem like a lot of work, and maybe making this 
						<a href="https://github.com/vgarciasc/xeupiu">texthooker project</a> work is a better use of 
						time.</li> --> 
					<!-- <li>My nootropics stack right now is: Pocari Sweat, nose strips, being happy</li> -->

				<h4>Things I am interested in hearing about:</h4>
				<p>How to get rid of "stimulation addiction", 
				well-made dating sims (maybe with a stat mechanic?), ambient/field recordings/experimental/instrumental
				hip-hop music, good unique anime (if you ctrl-F "anime" on Library you can 
				see what I like), good unique movies/books, non-slop contemporary Japanese literature, better/out-there
				language learning methods/applications (with a focus on Japanese)</p>
