REPRESENTATION THEORY REVIEW:
a representation is representing a group as matrices over some complex vector space
when subspace is fixed by every element you can restrict to it and get a subrep
no subreps is called irreducible
can decompose any representation into direct sum of irreducible representations

some shit about only linear maps that commute with G being scalar multiples of identity (schur's lemma) idk

character of representation: function from G -> C given by trace of g
is a "class function" (i.e., constant on conjugacy classes) since trace is invariant under conjugation
define inner product on vector space of class functions by standard complex dot product (remember conjugate on second term!) and then dividing by |G| to normalize to 1
under this inner products, the irreducible characters form an orthonormal basis

character table: write all values of all the irreducible characters lol. square cause # of conjugacy classes = # of irreducible characters by above

column orthogonality: take the inner product of the column vectors of character table. if g and h are not conjugate (i.e. different columns) then 0. if they're conjugate then you get size of centralizer of g or h (same thing)

common representations:
trivial representation: one dimensional vector space, map everything to identity
permutation representation: if you have some group action, make basis vectors your set elements, and elements of g permutation matrices
regular representation: special case of above where the action is of G on itself
degree 1 representations: automorphisms of F is just F* and every element of g has finite order so you just get roots of unity
