The following excerpt is from the introduction to "The Penguin Book of Short Stories" (2018, edited by Jay Rubin) written by Haruki Murakami:

> The first time I visited the offices of the New Yorker, I was shown around by
> the then editor-in-chief, Robert Gottlieb. When we got back to his office, I
> noticed he had three copies of Tanizaki's *The Makioka Sisters*
> (*Sasameyuki*, 1944-9) on his shelf and asked him why that should be. 'I do
> it so people will ask me that question,' he said with a smile. 'Then I can
> tell them what a great book I think it is and, if they show interest, I can
> give them a copy.' How pleased Tanizaki would have been to hear that.
